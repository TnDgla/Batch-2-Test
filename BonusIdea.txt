IDEA :- 

We can make a feature like, students can create groups and add their friends in the group and it will create a mini dashboard for those particular students, it can help students to compete with their friends and it will be fun and encourage them to up their rank.

IMPLEMENTATION :-

1. First we will create a frontend which is basically a form to create a group and add students in it.
2. Now we have data like group name and it's members, now we can save the group and render those particular students in the mini dashboard of the group.
3. We get those students by filtering them from the main data, and then we can show their data in the dashboard.


SMALL UPGRADES :-

1. we can add trophies of ranks for 1,2 and 3 in front of their names, or we can change UI to give more space to first three places.

2. Ranking students on basis of no. of questions solved is not right i think, instead we can calculate score like 1 point for easy, 3 for medium and 5 for hard. This will properly rank students, like if some student solved 1000 easy questions is not equal to 1000 hard questions.
